A few important points:<br/>

<ul>
<li>The EPA {{ PORTAL }} is a place for <em>creating and sharing maps and map applications</em>. Depending on your access level, you may only be able to view content items, or you may be able to collaborate by creating and editing items.</li>

<li>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is now required to be enabled on all accounts per <a href="https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2021-09/information_security_identification_and_authentication_procedure.pdf">security policy</a>.
Guidance for the simple process of enabling two-factor authentication can be found in <a href="https://epa.maps.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/079ede9b32464c73815d386703d3f88b/data">this document</a>.
You will have a short grace period following account creation to enable MFA, after which your account will be automatically disabled.

<li>We hope that you enjoy using this platform to build and enhance your mapping capabilities, but we also have one major rule to consider as you use the {{ PORTAL }}: <br/>
<span style='color:red'>
<strong>No PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (PII) or National Security Information (NSI) can be stored on the {{ PORTAL }}.</strong>
</span><br/>
If you need a place for storing names, social security numbers, phone numbers, home addresses and the like â€“ PLEASE do not store them here.  PII or NSI found in the {{ PORTAL }}, whether added inadvertently or intentionally, will be removed.
</li>

</ul>

Thank you for your attention to this important information and welcome again to the {{ PORTAL }} community.<br/><br/>
